Hi I'm Andreas Klebinger. I'm interested in Haskell, Compilers, D&D and most other things if presented well.

I currently reside near Vienna, Austria where I work from home
and study Software Engineering at TU Vienna on the side.

You can reach me on Twitter @AndreasK_Tweets.  
I also frequent #ghc on freenode (AndreasK).

You can also reach me at firstname . lastname @ gmx.at
