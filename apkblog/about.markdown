Hi I'm Andreas Klebinger. I'm interested in Haskell, Compilers, D&D and occasionally
get nerd sniped by other interests.

I currently reside near Vienna, Austria. I studied at TU Vienna but transitioned
into remote work during the pandemic. These days I mostly work on maintaining GHC
with Well-Typed.

I'm on Bluesky as AndreasPK but you can also reach me per mail on lastname . firstname @ gmx.at
